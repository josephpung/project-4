### Description
The service industry has not had the best in terms of technological advancements, an app to solve each problem, from queues to reservations to the traditional POS system.

We bring to you the all in one, from payment to reservation to seeing the current orders or customers in the queue. No more walking from one end of the restaurant to the other just to check the POS, now you can do everything from one device.
